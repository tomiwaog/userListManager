All files to be read are under data/ directory
You can specify a different reading directory by changin parameter in Main()
Some testing done to ensure file being read exist at location is a corresponding file type to method being invoked.
E.g. Method reading CSV File will not permit a different extension passed in as parameter.

File can be output to any extension type provided its set in the parameter.
Files written are stored in project directory.

Some Exception Caught

Logic:
CSV File, XML File and JSON File are imported seperated
the 3 file types are combined into one array (including all Usertype objects
Combined array is sorted using collection.sort()
Sorted combined array is exported into XML, JSON and CSV Seperately.

Some presentation error.
JSON output format exactly as input format.

--Improvement --
Formatting could be improved
More refactoring could be done, to reduce duplication.
OOProgramming could be improved greatly.
Documentation and Userguide could be made.
Manally written sorting algorithm could be implemented to showcase optimization on runtime.
